Welcome to the Cardano Developer Portal. This content is for technical people; if you are looking for a Cardano wallet please head to the\\\

It is noteworthy to mention that the Developer Portal covers everything you can do\\\

What is Cardano?\\\
​\\\
Cardano is a collection of\\\
open-source\\\
, patent-free protocols. It's a platform that enables you to store, transform, and manage value, identity, and governance. Cardano follows research not opinions or bias.\\\
How did it start?\\\
​\\\
Cardano started as a significant research and development project in 2015, and it took almost two years of research to get to a position to start writing code.\\\
The purpose of Cardano was to ask: How can we build a sustainable financial and social operating system for billions of people? What collections of technologies do we need to bring together to get everything at an affordable cost?\\\
Besides cryptographic research, there was game-theoretic research, identity-management research, and programming-language research. This academic rigor process produced more than 100 academic papers.\"",\""This guide is written with\\\
cardano-cli\\\
v 1.27.0. Some commands may be subject to change.\\\
You have some knowledge in Linux as to navigation between directories, creating and editing files, and setting and inspecting variables via Linux shell.\\\
Overview\\\
​\\\
This tutorial will give you a copy & pastable walk through the complete token lifecycle:\\\
These will be the steps we need to take to complete the whole lifecycle:\\\
Set everything up\\\
Build a new address and keys\\\
Generate a minting policy\\\
Draft a minting transaction\\\
Calculate fees\\\
Send the transaction and mint tokens (to ourselves)\\\
Send the tokens to a Daedalus wallet\\\
Burn some token\\\
Directory structure\\\
​\\\
We'll be working in a new directory. Here is an overview of every file we will be generating:\\\
├── burning.raw                    # Raw transaction to burn token\\\
├── burning.signed                 # Signed transaction to burn token\\\
├── matx.raw                       # Raw transaction to mint token\\\
├── matx.signed                    # Signed transaction to mint token\\\
├── metadata.json                  # Metadata to specify NFT attributes\\\
├── payment.addr                   # Address to send / receive\\\

└── protocol.json                  # Protocol parameters\\\
Token architecture\\\
​\\\
Before minting native assets, you need to ask yourself at least those four questions:\\\
What will be the name of my custom token(s)?\\\
How many do I want to mint?\\\
Will there be a time constraint for interaction (minting or burning token?)\"",\""wrong arguments\\\

Hopefully this gives you ideas on what you can build on Cardano. This example should\\\
also illustrate how most of the code in your dapp isn't even the validators.\"",\""\\\

What have you been up to?\"",\""What collections of technologies do we need to bring together to get everything at an affordable cost?\\\
Besides cryptographic research, there was game-theoretic research, identity-management research, and programming-language research. This academic rigor process produced more than 100 academic papers. Most were accepted in cryptography conferences like Eurocrypt and Asiacrypt and went through the standard peer-review process. For example, the paper\\\
“Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocol”\\\
was one of\\\
the most cited security papers from 2015-2019\\\
.\\\
What you need to bring\\\
​\\\
To get the most out of the Cardano Developer Portal, you should  have programming experience and a basic understanding of blockchain concepts of Cardano such as\\\
UTxO\\\
,\\\
transactions\\\
,\\\
addresses\\\
,\\\
key derivation\\\
, and\\\
networking\\\
.\\\
If you are unfamiliar with these terms, start with\\\
technical concepts\\\
, and you can complete the\\\
stake pool course\\\
afterward. It will also help you understand basic concepts, even if you don't want to run a stake pool.\\\
Cardano is different\\\
​\\\
If you have experience with other smart contract platforms and want to start building on Cardano, it is vital to know its differences:\\\
It makes sense to get your head around the\\\
concept of UTxO\\\
and later\\\
the extended UTxO model\\\
.\\\
Tokens on Cardano\\\
are not built with smart contracts. Instead, tokens are native and live on the ledger. The protocol treats them as first-class citizens, like ada. It is quite different from our peers that don’t have native tokens and need to use a smart contract to send tokens.\"",\""We first set our\\\
constants\\\
addr, datumConstr, redeemer\\\
, as explained\\\
previously in this guide we use the\\\
Always Succeed\\\
script\\\
that contains no specific validating logic.  Although it is called \\\\\\\""always\\\
succeeds\\\\\\\"", it is important to note that contracts on Cardano currently\\\
always require a datum to be supplied that is the\\\
same\\\
as the one locked\\\
at the script in the UTxO we are trying to spend.  However, we can use\\\
a random redeemer. Then we use the previously defined{' '}\\\
_getAssetUtxo\\\
function to fetch the UTxO we are trying\\\
to spend. The next step is to build the unlocking transaction in\\\
tx\\\
{' '}\\\
where we pass all the necessary fields to unlock funds from the\\\
script.\\\
Finally, let's change the\\\
return\\\
function once more, changing it\\\
so that it unlocks funds this time. Replace with the following code:\\\
Connect Wallet\\\
{connected && (\\\
<>\\\
Unlock your funds from your contract\\\
unlockFunds()}\\\
disabled={connecting || loading}\\\
style={{\\\
margin: \\\\\\\""8px\\\\\\\"",\\\
backgroundColor: connecting || loading ? \\\\\\\""orange\\\\\\\"" : \\\\\\\""grey\\\\\\\"",\\\
}}\\\
>\\\
Unlock funds\\\
)}\\\
);`}\\\
isJson={false}\\\
/>\\\
Visit{' '}\\\
http://localhost:3000\\\
{' '}\\\
and unlock your funds.\\\
4. Explore further\\\
Congratulations, you've succesfully integrated your smart contract\\\
into a web application!\\\
Now you may want to explore more complex datum/redeemer structures,\\\
V2 features, Plutus minting and more. Mesh supports each of these\\\
features and we are continuously working on adding more guides and\\\
expanding the docs.\"",\""The transaction is presented to each user via a web application, where they can sign the transaction using their wallet. They then send it to a backend API that assembles the witness signatures and submits the transaction to the blockchain only once it has the minimum required signers. ## Closing Thoughts Cardano offers unique built-in functionality that enables the integration of simple yet effective rules within its addresses. These rules, once attached, are evaluated by the ledger at the time of each transaction. This method is more straightforward compared to an EVM smart contract, as it focuses on rules that are directly associated with individual transactions, thus streamlining the process and eliminating the need to evaluate against the entire account. Another very useful use case is a vesting address. The funds in the address can not be spent until a certain amount of time has passed. However, if native scripts are written incorrectly, they could end up locking the funds in the address forever. For example, incorrectly using 'Time locking' scripts with 'after' and 'before' conditions can lead to this issue, so it's important to test the script on a testnet before deploying it to the mainnet. Here, you will find the documentation of the available native scripts in Cardano.\"",\""And iterating. 100x speed.{' '}\\\

as\\\
f\\\
:\\\

write\\\
(\\\

You can run the instructions above using:\\\
python generate-credentials.py\\\
Now, we can head to\\\
the Cardano faucet\\\
(opens in a new tab)\\\
to get some funds on the preview network to our newly created address (inside\\\
me.addr\\\
).\\\
👉 Make sure to select\\\
\\\\\\\""Preview Testnet\\\\\\\""\\\
as network.\\\
Using\\\
CardanoScan\\\
(opens in a new tab)\\\
we can watch for the faucet sending some ADA our way. This should be pretty fast (a couple of seconds).\\\
Using the contract\\\
Now that we have some funds, we can lock them in our newly created contract. We'll use\\\
PyCardano\\\
(opens in a new tab)\\\
to construct and submit our transaction through\\\
Blockfrost\\\
(opens in a new tab)\\\
.\\\
This is only one example of possible setup using tools we love. For more\\\
tools, make sure to check out the\\\
Cardano Developer\\\
Portal\\\
(opens in a new tab)\\\
!\\\
Setup\\\
First, we setup PyCardano with Blockfrost as a provider. This will allow us to let PyCardano handle transaction building for us, which includes managing changes. It also gives us a direct way to submit the transaction later on.\"",\""This example should\\\
also illustrate how most of the code in your dapp isn't even the validators. When designing\\\
applications that leverage Cardano it's always better to think about what kinds of transactions\\\
you'll need to construct and then writing your validators to enforce them. A full reference\\\
to this example can be found\\\

Let's write and execute a smart contract on Cardano in 10 minutes. Yes, you read that right.\\\
You can find code supporting this tutorial on\\\
Aiken's main repository\\\

Covered in this tutorial\\\
Writing a basic Aiken validator;\\\
Writing & running tests with Aiken;\\\
Troubleshooting smart contracts.\\\
📘\\\
When encountering an unfamiliar syntax or concept, do not hesitate to refer to\\\
the\\\
language-tour\\\
for details and extra examples.\\\
Pre-requisites\\\
We'll use Aiken to write the script so make the command-line installed already or else, look at the\\\
installation instructions\\\
.\\\
Scaffolding\\\
First, let's create a new Aiken project:\\\
aiken new aiken-lang/hello-world\\\
cd hello-world\\\
This command scaffolds an Aiken project. In particular, it creates a\\\
lib\\\
and\\\
validators\\\
folders in which you can put Aiken source files.\\\
./hello-world\\\
│\\\
├── README.md\\\
├── aiken.toml\\\
├── lib\\\
│   └── hello-world\\\
└── validators\\\
Using the standard library\\\
We'll use the\\\
standard library\\\
(opens in a new tab)\\\
for writing our validator. Fortunately,\\\
aiken new\\\
did automatically add the standard\\\
library to our\\\
aiken.toml\\\
for us.\""]

## Quitting stake pool\\\
At any point we can decide to quit delegation all together. Quitting stake pool will cause de-registration of the stake key associated to our wallet and our deposit will be returned. After that we're not longer going to receive rewards.\\\
Quitting can be done in old transaction workflow:\\\
- [`DELETE /stake-pools/*/wallets/{walletId}`](https://cardano-foundation.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/#operation/quitStakePool)\\\

All rewards will be withdrawn automatically upon quitting a stake pool.\\\

Welcome to the Cardano Developer Portal. This content is for technical people; if you are looking for a Cardano wallet please head to the\\\

What is Cardano?\\\
​\\\
Cardano is a collection of\\\
open-source\\\
, patent-free protocols. It's a platform that enables you to store, transform, and manage value, identity, and governance. Cardano follows research not opinions or bias.\\\
How did it start?\\\
​\\\
Cardano started as a significant research and development project in 2015, and it took almost two years of research to get to a position to start writing code.\\\
The purpose of Cardano was to ask: How can we build a sustainable financial and social operating system for billions of people? What collections of technologies do we need to bring together to get everything at an affordable cost?\\\
Besides cryptographic research, there was game-theoretic research, identity-management research, and programming-language research. This academic rigor process produced more than 100 academic papers.\"",\""The entire Bitcoin network has a grinding power of about\\\
10^12\\\
. So\\\
unless the entire Bitcoin network is attacking Cardano,\\\
g\\\
is likely smaller\\\
than\\\
10^12\\\
. For the adversary proportion, as a rule of thumb, it's good to\\\
look at the total stake of the largest stake pools to get an idea of how much\\\
power can a single entity gather.\\\
A good recommendation for sensitive transactions is thus to wait around 100-150\\\
blocks (30-50 min) whereas a few blocks is usually sufficient for small\\\
payments. If you want to play with the equation, feel free to look at\\\
this interactive calculator\\\
(opens in a new tab)\\\
.\\\
Developer Portal\\\
There exists plenty of resources available on Cardano. Though there are a bit\\\
hard to find sometimes. As a rule of thumb (and unfortunately): avoid\\\
http://docs.cardano.org\\\
(opens in a new tab)\\\
as it is often inaccurate, plain wrong or missing\\\
crucial elements.\\\
On the other hand, the\\\
Cardano Developer\\\
Portal\\\
(opens in a new tab)\\\
is a good entry point to many of the\\\
ecosystem tooling and resources. The \\\\\\\""Builder Tools\\\\\\\"" section is particularly\\\
furnished. It is community-maintained, curated and under constant evolution.\\\

We've now completed the example and have a fun little prototype.\\\
Conclusion\\\
Hopefully this gives you ideas on what you can build on Cardano. This example should\\\
also illustrate how most of the code in your dapp isn't even the validators.\"",\""CardanoSharp/cardanosharp.github.io\

This isn't the right place to get help for these questions but there is an informed & helpful community with lots of node building experience here:\\\
https://t.me/CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup\\\
Note a lot of dependency problems can be resolved by running\\\
cabal update\\\
(I always run it 3 times, mainly for metaphysical reasons)\\\

[iohk-monitoring-framework][] provides a facility for adjusting log\\\
levels at runtime on a component by component basis.\\\

## New transaction workflow\\\
[New transaction workflow](https://cardano-foundation.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/#tag/Transactions-New) decouples creation of the transaction into separate steps:\\\
- Construct: [`POST /wallets/{walletId}/transactions-construct`](https://cardano-foundation.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/#operation/constructTransaction)\\\
- Sign: [`POST /wallets/{walletId}/transactions-sign`](https://cardano-foundation.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/#operation/signTransaction)\\\
- Submit: [`POST /wallets/{walletId}/transactions-submit`](https://cardano-foundation.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/#operation/submitTransaction)\\\
Behind the scene, on the **construct** step, the wallet engine will select necessary inputs belonging to the wallet, generate a change address of the wallet and calculate the `fee` for this particular transaction.\\\
**Sign** and **submit** are now invoked as separate steps. This allows for presenting the actual transaction `fee` to the end user. In the old workflow, when all those steps where done in one go, showing precise fee was not possible and it had to be estimated using separate wallet endpoint. Because of the random nature of coin-selection algorithm such estimation might not have been always the same as the actual transaction fee.\"",\""wallet.log\\\

#### Common Failures and Resolution\\\
##### No More Wallets\\\
If your test fails with something like:\\\
```\\\
user error (No more faucet wallet available in MVar!)\\\
```\\\
Generate more wallet mnemonics and populate the appropriate list in `lib/wallet/src/Test/Integration/Faucet.hs`.\\\
Generate new mnemonics with:\\\
```\\\
nix build .#cardano-wallet\\\
# Size may vary depending on which array you need to add to.\\\
./result/bin/cardano-wallet recovery-phrase generate --size 15\\\
```\\\
## Mock servers\\\
Use the `cardano-wallet:mock-token-metadata-server` executable as a\\\
mock server for asset metadata. See the `--help` output for full\\\
instructions.\\\
## Benchmarks\\\
### Database\\\
```\\\
$ cabal bench cardano-wallet:db\\\
```\\\
### Restoration\\\
#### Pre-requisites\\\
1. Follow the pre-requisites from `integration` above\\\
2. (Optional) Install [hp2pretty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hp2pretty)\\\
```\\\
$ cabal install hp2pretty\\\
```\\\
#### Test\\\
```admonish warning\\\
Restoration benchmarks will catch up with the chain before running which can\\\
take quite a long time in the case of `mainnet`. For a better experience, make\\\
sure your system isn't too far behind the tip before running.\"",\""The entire Bitcoin network has a grinding power of about\\\

look at the total stake of the largest stake pools to get an idea of how much\\\
power can a single entity gather.\\\

blocks (30-50 min) whereas a few blocks is usually sufficient for small\\\

#### Note\\\
This scheme is an underspecified / ad-hoc scheme designed in the early eras of\\\
Cardano. It is intrinsically entangled to the address format and relies on\\\
the ability to embed extra pieces of information into addresses themselves in\\\
order to perform key derivation.\\\
An initial key is created using a Ed25519 cryptographic elliptic curve from a\\\
seed (encoded in the form of mnemonic words). From this wallet Key, other keys\\\
can be derived. We therefore define a hierarchy of depth 2, where a single root\\\
key and derivation indexes defines a **derivation path**.\\\
We typically represent that derivation path as follows:\\\
```\\\
m/account_ix'/address_ix'\\\

It supports the following features out of the box: * Building and serialising wallet primitives (i.e. recovery-phrases, keys, addresses and transactions) * Live querying of accounts, addresses, transactions and native assets across both Testnet and Mainnet networks * Submitting transactions to the Testnet or Mainnet network * Cryptographic and encoding transformations (blake2b, bech32, etc.) Why would you use `cscli` in addition to `cardano-cli`, `cardano-address`, `cardano-wallet` and a host of other tools? ### Advantages * Simple installation and powerful commands with **no dependencies** on a local full node or other tools/sdks * Easy recovery-phrase (aka mnemonic) based key and address derivation for Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets, perfect for offline management * Passphrase support for additional root key security * International multi-language](https://github.com/CardanoSharp/cardanosharp-wallet/tree/main/CardanoSharp.Wallet/Words) support for [recovery-phrases * Generates compatible outputs for `cardano-cli`, `cardano-address` and `cardano-wallet` ##\"",\""(Any light wallet assumes this.) In the MVP, we use [Blockfrost][] for demonstration purposes.\\\

# Design alternatives\\\
## Byron wallets\\\
Byron wallets cannot be supported by the light-mode as described above, as it is based on an efficient query `Address -> Transactions` which Byron wallets cannot take advantage of. For these wallets, alternative designs would have to be explored. Possibilities include:\\\
* A third-party byron *address discovery service* which takes a byron root XPub and sends back a list of addresses belonging to that wallet. However, that involve an additional reduction in trust.\\\
* Existing Byron wallets can be *partially supported* in light-mode as long as the database of addresses generated/discovered so far is intact, as we can still retrieve the balance and all transactions. However, in light-mode, these wallets cannot be restored and cannot receive funds from newly generated addresses.\"",\""\\\

It would be no different from exposing the keys to your bank account to the internet!\\\
You can connect to the wallet by attaching a container to the network and using the internal port.\\\
```bash\\\
docker run -it --network mainnet_default alpine/curl curl http://cardano-wallet:8090/v2/network/information | jq\\\
```\\\
Or modify the `docker-compose.yml` to host your client in the `mainnet_default` network.\\\
### Running on preprod\\\
Preprod network is broken for node 9.0.0 at some block in the past.\\\
One way to overcome that limitation is to download a snapshot that used an old version node (1.35.2)\\\
to trespass that point.\\\
Use `snpashot.sh` to download the snapshot.\\\
```bash\\\
cd run/preprod/docker\\\
./snapshot.sh\\\
./run.sh sync\\\

What is Cardano?\\\
​\\\
Cardano is a collection of\\\
open-source\\\
, patent-free protocols. It's a platform that enables you to store, transform, and manage value, identity, and governance. Cardano follows research not opinions or bias.\\\
How did it start?\\\
​\\\
Cardano started as a significant research and development project in 2015, and it took almost two years of research to get to a position to start writing code.\\\
The purpose of Cardano was to ask: How can we build a sustainable financial and social operating system for billions of people? What collections of technologies do we need to bring together to get everything at an affordable cost?\\\
Besides cryptographic research, there was game-theoretic research, identity-management research, and programming-language research. This academic rigor process produced more than 100 academic papers.\""]

The code used in this post is verbose, and it might feel somewhat repetitive, but the purpose behind that is to illustrate the steps in detail so you can modify it to suit your context. Cardano has an elegant way of handling tokens without needing custom smart contracts. This has many benefits, including but not limited to security, low transaction cost, simplicity and speed. Using a library like CardanSharp simplifies the integration between a dotnet application and the Cardano blockchain. In future posts, we'll look at minting and burning NFTs.\"",\""\\\
What are native tokens/assets?\\\
​\\\
The Cardano Blockchain has the unique ability to create, interact with, and delete bespoke tokens (or 'assets') natively. In this example, native means that, in addition to sending and receiving the official currency ada, you may interact with custom assets right out of the box - without the use of smart contracts.\\\
Native assets can practically be treated as ada in every sense because the capability is already built-in. Of course, there are some limitations (which we'll discuss later), but you can think of native assets as a way to produce your own custom for the time being.\\\
What you need to know\\\
​\\\
Before we go any further, here's a quick rundown of what you need to know.\\\
How we interact with the blockchain\\\
​\\\
Almost all interactions with the Cardano network/blockchain are transaction-based. We can divide interactions into two tiers with this in mind.\\\
The top layer emphasizes a visual approach and covers standard interaction. Sending and receiving ada or tokens, delegating your stake, and voting are all examples of this. Wallets such as the full node Daedalus wallet or the lighter Yoroi wallet can be used to carry out these interactions.\\\
However, if we want to drill down and have more options for interacting and creating \\\\\\\""custom\\\\\\\"" interactions, we must go one step deeper. We'll need a whole node in this layer to send transactions with specified parameters. A full node is often a built binary from the official latest cardano-node repository.\"",\""\\\

## Overview\\\
The Cardano Blockchain features a unique ability to create (mint), interact (send and receive) and destroy (burn) custom tokens (or so-called 'assets') in a native way. Native, in this case, means besides sending and receiving the official currency ada, you can also interact with custom assets out of the box - without the need for smart contracts.\\\

## Assets on wallet balance\\\
You can easily check what assets you have on your wallet balance. Just look for `assets` in the response of [GET /wallets/{walletId}](https://cardano-foundation.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/#operation/getWallet).\"",\""\\\

Native tokens\\\
use the core infrastructure, and the network has to do everything else instead of running a smart contract and calling a method called 'transfer'. On Cardano, you are sending a standard transaction. This removes a layer of extra complexity and the risk of human mistakes, as the ledger handles all token-related functions.\\\

These tokens engage with the network with the same level of efficiency and security as ADA, the blockchain's primary currency. Thanks to Cardano's innovative multi-asset ledger, it's possible to define custom tokens that transact in tandem with ADA, yet stand out with distinct properties and governance outlined by specific minting policies. In this post, we'll delve into the capabilities of CardanoSharp, focusing on how it facilitates the minting, transferring, and burning of native tokens. Before we start minting, we need to talk about policies. ### **Understanding Minting Policies** Cardano minting policies are rules in its smart contract language that control when and how new tokens are made or destroyed. These rules, once made, can't be changed and might include things like how long you have to mint tokens, who needs to sign off on it, and other necessary steps. They provide a secure and consistent way for token creators to manage their tokens on the Cardano network, according to the rules they set up at the start.\""]

The testnets are an essential part of the development process for Cardano, as they allow developers to test and refine their code before deploying it on the live network, ultimately improving reliability and security.\\\
What testnet should I use?\\\
​\\\
Preview Testnet\\\
​\\\
The Preview Testnet is a testing environment used to showcase new features and functionality to the Cardano community before they are deployed on the Mainnet.\\\
It allows developers and users to test and provide feedback on new features and changes before they are released to the wider community.\\\
The Preview Testnet helps to ensure that new features are user-friendly and meet the needs of the community, ultimately improving the user experience on the Mainnet.\\\
Leads Mainnet hard forks by at least 4 weeks.\\\
You can download the current Cardano blockchain network configuration files for Preview Testnet here:\\\

What is Cardano?\\\
​\\\
Cardano is a collection of\\\
open-source\\\
, patent-free protocols. It's a platform that enables you to store, transform, and manage value, identity, and governance. Cardano follows research not opinions or bias.\\\
How did it start?\\\
​\\\
Cardano started as a significant research and development project in 2015, and it took almost two years of research to get to a position to start writing code.\\\
The purpose of Cardano was to ask: How can we build a sustainable financial and social operating system for billions of people? What collections of technologies do we need to bring together to get everything at an affordable cost?\\\
Besides cryptographic research, there was game-theoretic research, identity-management research, and programming-language research. This academic rigor process produced more than 100 academic papers.\"",\""\\\

A good recommendation for sensitive transactions is thus to wait around 100-150\\\
blocks (30-50 min) whereas a few blocks is usually sufficient for small\\\

We've now completed the example and have a fun little prototype.\\\
Conclusion\\\
Hopefully this gives you ideas on what you can build on Cardano. This example should\\\
also illustrate how most of the code in your dapp isn't even the validators.\"",\""Cardano Native Tokens with CardanoSharp - Sarmaad Amin Cardano native tokens are digital assets that operate directly on the Cardano blockchain protocol, negating the need for smart contracts, as they are inherently supported by the ledger itself. These tokens engage with the network with the same level of efficiency and security as ADA, the blockchain's primary currency. Thanks to Cardano's innovative multi-asset ledger, it's possible to define custom tokens that transact in tandem with ADA, yet stand out with distinct properties and governance outlined by specific minting policies. In this post, we'll delve into the capabilities of CardanoSharp, focusing on how it facilitates the minting, transferring, and burning of native tokens. Before we start minting, we need to talk about policies. ### **Understanding Minting Policies** Cardano minting policies are rules in its smart contract language that control when and how new tokens are made or destroyed. These rules, once made, can't be changed and might include things like how long you have to mint tokens, who needs to sign off on it, and other necessary steps. They provide a secure and consistent way for token creators to manage their tokens on the Cardano network, according to the rules they set up at the start.\"",\""\\\
Participate in the discussions to determine this.\\\
How to connect with the developer community?\\\
​\\\
Cardano developers and stake pool operators spread across many different platforms.\\\
We aim to provide a complete overview.\\\
If you are interested in connecting with people from the Developer Portal, either visit\\\
the Discord\\\
or\\\
open a thread in the forum\\\
.\\\
Installation\\\
​\\\
To contribute to the Cardano developer portal, you must first install it locally. We have chosen\\\
Docusaurus 2\\\
, a modern static website generator, as the underlying software.\\\
Requirements\\\
​\\\
Node.js\\\
version >= 16.14 (which can be checked by running\\\
node -v\\\
). You can use\\\
nvm\\\
for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.\\\
Yarn\\\
version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running\\\
yarn --version\\\
). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the\\\
npm\\\
client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.\\\
On macOS you also need Xcode and Command Line Tools.\\\
Local development\\\
​\\\
To get a local development environment, clone the repository, navigate into the\\\
developer-portal\\\
folder, install dependencies, and start the development server. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. By default, a browser window will open at\\\
http://localhost:3000\\\
.\\\
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cardano-foundation/developer-portal.git\\\
cd developer-portal\\\
yarn install\\\
yarn start\\\
Limitations of the development build\\\
The development mode will have minor features not working. For example, only blurry images in the responsive images on showcase and tools, search limitations, and some data has fake values because of performance reasons.\"",\""For example, we will need to check the balance of a wallet's account, retrieve a list of unspent UTXOs and submit transactions. There are several ways to do this, like: * Setting up your own Cardano node and GraphQL or/and DB sync, * using a service like Blockfrost, which makes it quick and easy for developers to integrate Cardano without managing blockchain infrastructure * using a service like Koios Decentralised API, which offers a generous free tier and accepts subscription payment in ADA 💡 I have personally used both services, and I would encourage you to review their capabilities to make sure they meet your project needs! > In this post, I will not focus on any of the above services SDKs. I will be using Postman to demonstrate the usecase. > > If you want me to cover more details and usage patterns, do let me know. ## Query Account Balance Using Koios account\\\\_info endpoint, let's find out the account balance. From the response, the account has a balance of 10,000,000,000 Lovelace. Given that 1 ADA equals 1,000,000 Lovelace, the total balance is 10,000 ADA. ❗ The faucet will fund accounts with a 10k ADA for testing and development purposes.\"",\""\\\

## Pre-requisites\\\
- [how to start a server](start-wallet-server.md)\\\
- [how to create a wallet](create-a-wallet.md)\\\
- In order to be able to send transactions, our wallet must have funds. In case of `preview` and `preprod` [testnets](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/testnets/cardano/overview/) we can request tADA from the [faucet](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/testnets/cardano/tools/faucet/).\\\
## Transaction Metadata\\\
Since the Shelley era, the Cardano blockchain allows user-defined data to be associated with transactions.\\\
The metadata hash is part of the transaction body, so is covered by all transaction signatures.\"",\""$Nike, in the context of Cardano, is a meme coin that was inspired by a picture of Charles  Hoskinson's pet pig, also named Nike. The phrase “He’s a good pig.” is synonymous with Nike.   This coin quickly gained popularity within the Cardano community, amassing a market  capitalization of 1.72 million ADA, approximately $650,000, in a short period. It became the third  most traded token in the Cardano ecosystem, highlighting the community's enthusiasm and the  influence of social media attention on market trends.   Some common things said about $Nike in the context of Cardano include:   1. \\\""If The Nike Society fails, Cardano fails.\\\"" - This phrase suggests that the success of the  Nike Society is closely tied to the success of the Cardano ecosystem.   2. \\\""What $Nike has done is honestly so good for Cardano.\\\"" - This statement praises the  positive impact of $Nike on the Cardano community and ecosystem.   3. \\\""$Nike is the go-to on Cardano.\\\"" - This statement suggests that $Nike is a popular and  essential part of the Cardano ecosystem.   4. \\\""Are you talking about $Nike on Cardano?\\\"" - This question indicates that $Nike is a  well-known entity within the Cardano community.   5. \\\""I'm new to Cardano... What's a $Nike?\\\""\"",\""\\\

        You are cDPT-1, an AI assistant specialized in Cardano development. Your primary role is to assist developers in building dApps and games on the Cardano blockchain. You provide detailed information and guidance on Cardano development tools, languages, SDKs, and APIs.
        As an AI Assistant, you represent Cardano and cDPT-1 in a professional manner at all times.
        - Use a professional tone.
        - Limit comments to topics within the scope of Cardano development and refrain from discussing competitors.
        - Avoid using first-person pronouns such as \""I,\"" \""my,\"" \""me,\"" or \""mine.\""
        - ALWAYS be kind.
        - If the user input includes what appears to be frustration or sarcasm, first acknowledge the concern and then proceed to assist.
        - Use conversational terms instead of \""based on the information at hand\"" or \""according to the information provided\"".
        - DO NOT make any commitments on behalf of Cardano or IOG, IOHK, or Cardano Foundation.
        - You are expected to represent Cardano and cDPT-1 in the best possible light.

A grid container as parent\\\
If the absolutely positioned child has a grid container as a parent but that container does not create a new positioning context, then it is taken out of flow as in the previous example. The positioning context will be whatever element creates a positioning context as is common to other layout methods. In our case, if we remove\\\
position: relative\\\
from the wrapper above, positioning context is from the viewport, as shown in this image.\\\
Once again the item no longer participates in the grid layout in terms of sizing or when other items are auto-placed.\\\
With a grid area as the parent\\\
If the absolutely positioned item is nested inside a grid area then you can create a positioning context on that area. In the below example we have our grid as before but this time I have nested an item inside\\\
.box3\\\
of the grid.\\\
I have given\\\
.box3\\\
position relative and then positioned the sub-item with the offset properties. In this case, the positioning context is the grid area.\"",\""\\\

how can I build statically linked cardano node binaries?\"",\""It also\\\
requires an API-Key as authentication method. We call this information the\\\
\\\\\\\""context\\\\\\\"".\\\
To configure a new context:\\\
dmtrctl\\\
init\\\
and follow the steps provided by the CLI to store the required values in the local configuration. Alternatively, required\\\
values can be retrieved from the Console (Web UI).\\\
Command Hierarchy\\\
The CLI is organized by a hierarchy of sub-commands. Each commands might also\\\
contains nested sub-commands. Each command provides quick usage instructions by\\\
using the\\\
--help\\\
flag (such as\\\
dmtrctl <SUBCOMMAND> --help\\\
)\\\
Advanced Configuration\\\
dmtrctl\\\
uses a configuration file located within the root dir of the\\\
installation to store the context information. The default location for Mac and\\\
Linux users is\\\
~/.dmtr/config.toml\\\
but this can be changed by specifying a\\\
different root dir.\\\
To know in which context to execute a command,\\\
dmtrctl\\\
uses decision steps in\\\
the following order:\\\
if the\\\
--context\\\
option was specified, use this value\\\
if\\\
DMTR_CONTEXT\\\
env variables was specified, use this value\\\
if there's a default context defined in the configuration, use that value\\\
The location of the root dir can be changed by using the\\\
--root-dir\\\
option\\\
or the\\\
DMTR_ROOT_DIR\\\
env var.\\\

From the level of material support that the Cardano Foundation has shown lately for the Developer Portal and the CIP process, I would guess the only way this would be possible would be through a sizeable Project Catalyst bid in Fund 11 with a proposal scope to compensate existing CF Cardano Ambassadors qualified to submit technical translations in each of the target languages. 🤔\\\

How many do I want to mint?\\\
Will there be a time constraint for interaction (minting or burning token?)\"",\""The following are two example commands:\\\

How to connect with the developer community?\\\
​\\\
Cardano developers and stake pool operators spread across many different platforms.\\\
We aim to provide a complete overview.\\\
If you are interested in connecting with people from the Developer Portal, either visit\\\
the Discord\\\
or\\\
open a thread in the forum\\\
.\\\
Installation\\\
​\\\
To contribute to the Cardano developer portal, you must first install it locally. We have chosen\\\
Docusaurus 2\\\
, a modern static website generator, as the underlying software.\\\
Requirements\\\
​\\\
Node.js\\\
version >= 16.14 (which can be checked by running\\\
node -v\\\
). You can use\\\
nvm\\\
for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.\\\
Yarn\\\
version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running\\\
yarn --version\\\
). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the\\\
npm\\\
client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.\\\
On macOS you also need Xcode and Command Line Tools.\\\
Local development\\\
​\\\
To get a local development environment, clone the repository, navigate into the\\\
developer-portal\\\
folder, install dependencies, and start the development server. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. By default, a browser window will open at\\\
http://localhost:3000\\\
.\\\
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cardano-foundation/developer-portal.git\\\
cd developer-portal\\\
yarn install\\\
yarn start\\\
Limitations of the development build\\\
The development mode will have minor features not working. For example, only blurry images in the responsive images on showcase and tools, search limitations, and some data has fake values because of performance reasons.\"",\""/my-configs-i-just-copied-from-a-malicious-site\\\
WALLET_TAG=2024.7.7\\\
```\\\
### Nix\\\
You can use [Nix](https://nixos.org) to download the `cardano-wallet` and `cardano-node` executables.\\\
`cd` into the directory `./run/$NETWORK/nix` corresponding to your choice of NETWORK.\\\
The nix script serve only as a template, you can modify it to suit your needs.\\\
It actually support one only command `sync` that starts a wallet and a node and\\\
use the wallet api to wait for the node to sync, then it stops the wallet and the node.\\\
For example, to sync a node on `private` using nix:\\\
```bash\\\
cd run/private/nix\\\
./run.sh sync\\\
```\\\
`WALLET_TAG` is not supported in the nix script. You will run the code that you just cloned.\\\
NixOS users can also use the [NixOS service](https://cardano-foundation.github.io/cardano-wallet/user-guide/installation/use-nixos.html).\\\
### Running on mainnet\\\
On `mainnet`, the Minimum System Requirements for a `cardano-node` are high:\\\
- 200GB of disk space (for the history of blocks)\\\
- 24GB of RAM (for the current UTxO set)\\\
To speed up the synchronization process,\\\
you can download a snapshot of the `cardano-node` state database,\\\
but you will have much less security than the full Ouroboros consensus protocol.\"",\""We'll need a whole node in this layer to send transactions with specified parameters. A full node is often a built binary from the official latest cardano-node repository. There are more options, but we'll concentrate on the Linux version.\\\
So, what kinds of sophisticated transactions can we create with a full node, and how can we do it? Working on the command line and issuing transactions from there is the current method. Stake pool operators must utilize this method of transaction to register their stake pool or make changes to their commitment, among other things. However, we may utilize this method to produce, send, receive, and burn tokens.\\\
In the future, this probably will also be the place where smart contracts are written, tested, and maybe executed if there isn't a visual frontend.\\\
Constraints when working with tokens\\\
​\\\
Since we already learned that interaction with the network is almost always a transaction, we need to be aware of a few things enforced through network parameters.\\\
A fee must always be paid whether issuing a transaction or sending something. Currently, the cost is determined by the size of the transaction (read: how much \\\\\\\""information\\\\\\\"" gets sent). The size of a transaction can range from a simple \\\\\\\""A transmits 2 ada to B\\\\\\\"" to a considerably more sophisticated transaction with additional metadata.\\\
There is a minimum value that must be sent. Currently, the value is set to 1 ada.\"",\""That\\\
value can then be dispatched in one or more UTxO, as typically done with\\\
any input.\\\
The stake credentials associated with the account protect withdrawals as well.\\\
Who owns the stake credentials owns the right to withdraw from the account.\\\
This means that reward withdrawals can be commanded by a script (and\\\
thus an Aiken program).\\\
Native Scripts\\\
Before full-blown Plutus scripts, Cardano had a minimalistic scripting language\\\
usually referred to as\\\
\\\\\\\""Native Script\\\\\\\""\\\
or\\\
\\\\\\\""Phase-1 scripts\\\\\\\""\\\
. It still\\\
exists and provides simple, albeit useful, programmability features to Cardano.\\\
Native scripts come in the form of a little domain-specific language with 6\\\
constructors:\\\
key\\\
,\\\
all-of\\\
,\\\
any-of\\\
,\\\
n-of-m\\\
,\\\
after\\\
and\\\
before\\\
.\\\
In particular, they are quite handy in defining multisig addresses owned by\\\
multiple tenants. You can find more about native scripts in\\\
CIP-1854\\\
(opens in a new tab)\\\
and in the\\\
Formal Ledger Specification, Figure 4: Multi-signature via Native\\\
Scripts\\\
(opens in a new tab)\\\
.\\\
The 'clean' trick: avoid replaying blocks\\\
Sometimes, the Cardano node will perform a complete re-validation of the chain\\\
as an integrity check. It does so by scanning through its local files, and\\\
replaying\\\
blocks onto each other. On Mainnet, this procedure can take\\\
multiple hours and is caused, in principle, by mainly two things:\\\
A restart after a non-clean shutdown of the node (e.g. a SIGKILL, or power outage);\\\
A critical change in the ledger version.\"",\""./configure.py \\\\\\\\\\\

        [\""$Nike, in the context of Cardano, is a meme coin that was inspired by a picture of Charles  Hoskinson's pet pig, also named Nike. The phrase “He’s a good pig.” is synonymous with Nike.   This coin quickly gained popularity within the Cardano community, amassing a market  capitalization of 1.72 million ADA, approximately $650,000, in a short period. It became the third  most traded token in the Cardano ecosystem, highlighting the community's enthusiasm and the  influence of social media attention on market trends.   Some common things said about $Nike in the context of Cardano include:   1. \\\""If The Nike Society fails, Cardano fails.\\\"" - This phrase suggests that the success of the  Nike Society is closely tied to the success of the Cardano ecosystem.   2. \\\""What $Nike has done is honestly so good for Cardano.\\\"" - This statement praises the  positive impact of $Nike on the Cardano community and ecosystem.   3. \\\""$Nike is the go-to on Cardano.\\\"" - This statement suggests that $Nike is a popular and  essential part of the Cardano ecosystem.   4. \\\""Are you talking about $Nike on Cardano?\\\"" - This question indicates that $Nike is a  well-known entity within the Cardano community.   5. \\\""I'm new to Cardano...

What is Cardano?\\\
​\\\
Cardano is a collection of\\\
open-source\\\
, patent-free protocols. It's a platform that enables you to store, transform, and manage value, identity, and governance. Cardano follows research not opinions or bias.\\\
How did it start?\\\
​\\\
Cardano started as a significant research and development project in 2015, and it took almost two years of research to get to a position to start writing code.\\\
The purpose of Cardano was to ask: How can we build a sustainable financial and social operating system for billions of people? What collections of technologies do we need to bring together to get everything at an affordable cost?\\\
Besides cryptographic research, there was game-theoretic research, identity-management research, and programming-language research. This academic rigor process produced more than 100 academic papers.\"",\""\\\
Spelling/Term\\\
Comment\\\
ada\\\
When talking about the cryptocurrency, do not capitalize, unless at the beginning of a sentence. The idea behind this is to treat it like dollars or euros. If you are in doubt, in English, prefer ada over ADA. Capitalised ADA stands for the ticker symbol only.\\\
ADA\\\
The ticker symbol for ada, like EUR or USD.\\\
tAda\\\
Test ada is tAda, not tADA or TADA. See\\\

the Cardano Foundation\\\
Always use\\\
the\\\
Cardano Foundation.\\\
DApps\\\

dcSpark\\\
Creators of Flint Wallet and Milkomeda. Capitalized S, everything else lower case.\\\
EMURGO\\\
All caps in line with EMURGO’s branding.\\\
the Foundation\\\
Interchangeable with\\\
the Cardano Foundation\\\
, the is not capitalized, but Foundation should be.\\\
GitHub\\\
Note the capitalized H.\\\
Goguen\\\
The third era of the Cardano development focused on smart contracts. Named in honour of Joseph Goguen, an US computer scientist.\\\
IOHK\\\
IOHK is now IOG.\\\
IOG\\\
IOG was IOHK.\\\
Mainnet\\\
One word.  Capitalise when it's a noun (the\\\
Mainnet\\\
) but not when it's an adjective (\\\
mainnet\\\
functionality), qualified by another proper name (the Cardano\\\
mainnet\\\
), or used as a symbol (e.g. enable Marlowe on\\\
mainnet\\\
).\\\
Ouroboros\\\
Ouroboros is a family of Cardano's consensus protocols. There are different flavors: Classic, Praos, Genesis, Chronos\\\
sidechains\\\
One word.\\\

Two words.\"",\""The process for updating Nix dependencies (e.g. Haskell.nix) is easier and more sane - `nix flake lock`.\\\

- Reproducible development environments ([nix develop][flake.nix]).\\\
Nix is not required for `cardano-wallet` development, but it can help you a lot if you try it.\\\

How to connect with the developer community?\\\
​\\\
Cardano developers and stake pool operators spread across many different platforms.\\\
We aim to provide a complete overview.\\\
If you are interested in connecting with people from the Developer Portal, either visit\\\
the Discord\\\
or\\\
open a thread in the forum\\\
.\\\
Installation\\\
​\\\
To contribute to the Cardano developer portal, you must first install it locally. We have chosen\\\
Docusaurus 2\\\
, a modern static website generator, as the underlying software.\\\
Requirements\\\
​\\\
Node.js\\\
version >= 16.14 (which can be checked by running\\\
node -v\\\
). You can use\\\
nvm\\\
for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.\\\
Yarn\\\
version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running\\\
yarn --version\\\
). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the\\\
npm\\\
client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.\\\
On macOS you also need Xcode and Command Line Tools.\\\
Local development\\\
​\\\
To get a local development environment, clone the repository, navigate into the\\\
developer-portal\\\
folder, install dependencies, and start the development server. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. By default, a browser window will open at\\\
http://localhost:3000\\\
.\\\
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cardano-foundation/developer-portal.git\\\
cd developer-portal\\\
yarn install\\\
yarn start\\\
Limitations of the development build\\\
The development mode will have minor features not working. For example, only blurry images in the responsive images on showcase and tools, search limitations, and some data has fake values because of performance reasons.\"",\""\\\
Cardano has an energetic community and more than two million wallets. If you stick to specific standards, we are keen to try out and engage with new products. Participating now makes you a first mover.\\\
Cardano brings its venture fund. If you build on Cardano you can get\\\
your project funded\\\
. Every 6 to 8 weeks, projects can be proposed, discussed, and voted on by the Cardano community.\\\
Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain. By design, it consumes much less energy and computational power.\\\
Cardano is built with the rigor of high-assurance formal development methods. The consensus mechanism\\\
Ouroboros\\\
was delivered with several peer-reviewed papers presented in top-tier conferences and publications in cybersecurity and cryptography. If you build on Cardano, you build on this foundation.\\\

Recording features\\\
. Some versions of Skype have a recording feature that allows you to capture and share all or part of your audio / video call. The recording will be stored and shared as part of your conversation history with the person or group with whom the call occurred.\\\
You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording any communication. This may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the conversation or any other authorizations as required.\\\
Microsoft is not responsible for how you use your recordings or the recording features.\\\
Skype bots\\\
. Bots are programs offered by Microsoft or third parties that can do many useful things like search for news, play games, and more. Depending on their capabilities, bots may have access to your display name, Skype ID, country, region, language, and any messages, audio, video, or content that you share with the bot. Please review the bot profile and its privacy statement before engaging in a one-to-one or group conversation with a bot. You can delete a bot that you no longer wish to engage with. Prior to adding a bot to a group, please ensure that your group participants have consented to their information being shared with the bot.\\\
Captioning\\\
. Certain Skype features include accessibility functionality such as captioning. During Skype calls, a call participant can activate a voice-to-text feature, which allows the user to view the audio chat as text.\"",\""/components/site/metatags';\\\

        [\""Too many times I’ve been asked “well how much animation is too much?” and been tempted to say “any”, but this gives me (and the people asking me) some more solid guidelines on how we can approach animation responsibly.\\\
Thanks for writing this and spreading the word Val! One of the things I’ve been pushing the last week is to use hashtags #DZY and #SZR to indicate links that may induce vertigo or seizures respectively due to animation or movement on the site. Consider them the #NSFW and #TW equivalents for the motion sensitive.\\\
Thanks Anne! That’s exactly the sort of question I was looking to answer when researching this. Glad I could help!\\\
Happy to help spread the word, Greg. And thanks for all your help with the research! I like the idea of the hashtags to indicate potentially triggering links. I’m going to start using them in the next UI Animation Newsletter too.\\\
As an FYI, now that I’m looking at this article on a  computer and not a phone, the great header illustration by Sue Lockwood actually triggers me with the “double line” 3Dish thing going on in the middle tweening steps. Sometimes even the allusion to motion can be enough.\\\
Great read. My team is looking at how to tackle this issue internally. We came up with a toggle button similar to the demo provided.  Web accessibility is a big focus here in Canada!\\\

Welcome to the Cardano Developer Portal. This content is for technical people; if you are looking for a Cardano wallet please head to the\\\
showcase section\\\
.\\\
It is noteworthy to mention that the Developer Portal covers everything you can do\\\
today\\\
on the Cardano\\\
mainnet\\\
.\\\
What is Cardano?\\\
​\\\
Cardano is a collection of\\\
open-source\\\
, patent-free protocols. It's a platform that enables you to store, transform, and manage value, identity, and governance. Cardano follows research not opinions or bias.\\\
How did it start?\\\
​\\\
Cardano started as a significant research and development project in 2015, and it took almost two years of research to get to a position to start writing code.\\\
The purpose of Cardano was to ask: How can we build a sustainable financial and social operating system for billions of people? What collections of technologies do we need to bring together to get everything at an affordable cost?\\\
Besides cryptographic research, there was game-theoretic research, identity-management research, and programming-language research. This academic rigor process produced more than 100 academic papers.\"",\""If you need to ask for help, they will show the person helping you what you have already tried. This may well give you enough information to be able to search for likely problems and workarounds.\\\
If you are still struggling to fix the problem then having a reduced test case gives you something to ask for help with, by posting to a forum, or showing to a co-worker. You are much more likely to get help if you can show that you have done the work of reducing the problem and identifying exactly where it happens, before asking for help. A more experienced developer might be able to quickly spot the problem and point you in the right direction, and even if not, your reduced test case will enable them to have a quick look and hopefully be able to offer at least some help.\\\
In the instance that your problem is actually a bug in a browser, then a reduced test case can also be used to file a bug report with the relevant browser vendor (e.g. on Mozilla's\\\
bugzilla site\\\
).\\\
As you become more experienced with CSS, you will find that you get faster at figuring out issues. However, even the most experienced of us sometimes find ourselves wondering what on earth is going on. Taking a methodical approach, making a reduced test case, and explaining the issue to someone else will usually result in a fix being found.\"",\""The entire Bitcoin network has a grinding power of about\\\
10^12\\\
. So\\\
unless the entire Bitcoin network is attacking Cardano,\\\
g\\\
is likely smaller\\\
than\\\
10^12\\\
. For the adversary proportion, as a rule of thumb, it's good to\\\
look at the total stake of the largest stake pools to get an idea of how much\\\
power can a single entity gather.\\\
A good recommendation for sensitive transactions is thus to wait around 100-150\\\
blocks (30-50 min) whereas a few blocks is usually sufficient for small\\\
payments. If you want to play with the equation, feel free to look at\\\
this interactive calculator\\\
(opens in a new tab)\\\
.\\\
Developer Portal\\\
There exists plenty of resources available on Cardano. Though there are a bit\\\
hard to find sometimes. As a rule of thumb (and unfortunately): avoid\\\
http://docs.cardano.org\\\
(opens in a new tab)\\\
as it is often inaccurate, plain wrong or missing\\\
crucial elements.\\\
On the other hand, the\\\
Cardano Developer\\\
Portal\\\

ecosystem tooling and resources. The \\\\\\\""Builder Tools\\\\\\\"" section is particularly\\\

Besides cryptographic research, there was game-theoretic research, identity-management research, and programming-language research. This academic rigor process produced more than 100 academic papers. Most were accepted in cryptography conferences like Eurocrypt and Asiacrypt and went through the standard peer-review process. For example, the paper\\\
“Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocol”\\\
was one of\\\
the most cited security papers from 2015-2019\\\
.\\\
What you need to bring\\\
​\\\
To get the most out of the Cardano Developer Portal, you should  have programming experience and a basic understanding of blockchain concepts of Cardano such as\\\
UTxO\\\
,\\\
transactions\\\
,\\\
addresses\\\
,\\\
key derivation\\\
, and\\\
networking\\\
.\\\
If you are unfamiliar with these terms, start with\\\
technical concepts\\\
, and you can complete the\\\
stake pool course\\\
afterward. It will also help you understand basic concepts, even if you don't want to run a stake pool.\\\
Cardano is different\\\
​\\\
If you have experience with other smart contract platforms and want to start building on Cardano, it is vital to know its differences:\\\
It makes sense to get your head around the\\\
concept of UTxO\\\
and later\\\
the extended UTxO model\\\
.\\\
Tokens on Cardano\\\
are not built with smart contracts. Instead, tokens are native and live on the ledger. The protocol treats them as first-class citizens, like ada. It is quite different from our peers that don’t have native tokens and need to use a smart contract to send tokens.\"",\""We are then using the\\\
_getAssetUtxo\\\
function to retrieve the UTXO of the locked assets. We are then using the\\\
redeemValue\\\
function to redeem the locked assets, the\\\
sendValue\\\
function to send the assets to the owner's address, and the\\\
setRequiredSigners\\\
function to set the required signers.\\\
As the validator requires\\\
Hello, World!\\\
as the redeemer message, we are creating a new redeemer with the message\\\
Hello, World!\\\
. We are then using the\\\
build\\\
function to build the transaction, the\\\
signTx\\\
function to sign the transaction, and the\\\
submitTx\\\
function to submit the transaction to the Cardano blockchain.\\\

This is because the web has moved to this approach of designing responsively.\\\
It has also become much easier to achieve responsive designs with the help of the layout methods you have learned in these lessons. If you are new to web development today you have many more tools at your disposal than in the early days of responsive design. It is therefore worth checking the age of any materials you are using. While the historical articles are still useful, modern use of CSS and HTML makes it far easier to create elegant and useful designs, no matter what device your visitor views the site with.\\\

As an open-source project grounded in peer-reviewed research, it presents a fertile ground for developers seeking to leverage blockchain for real-world applications. The potential possibilities that arise from combining the robustness of Cardano with the versatility of the .NET are vast. We're on the cusp of a new era where blockchain is not just a buzzword but a foundational technology that can address some of the most pressing challenges of our digital age. CardanoSharp is a key that unlocks this potential, providing .NET developers with the means to contribute to a more equitable and efficient digital future. As the community around these technologies grows, so too will the opportunities for innovation, collaboration, and transformation. Next up in CardanoSharp: we'll mint native tokens, craft NFTs, and enable multi-sig transactions---unlocking Cardano's full potential for .NET developers.\"",\""\\\

There is a minimum value that must be sent. Currently, the value is set to 1 ada. This means that if we wish to send a token, we must include at least one ada in the transaction. This is to avoid huge amounts of custom tokens from being created and the network being flooded with custom token transactions.\\\
We currently (June 2021) have no standard way to define an NFT. There is an\\\
open pull request\\\
, however. Most of the current NFTs on Cardano mostly follow the proposed structure, as we will in this section.\\\
Please keep those constraints in mind if you want to work with native assets.\\\
Difference between \\\\\\\""regular\\\\\\\"" token and NFTs\\\
​\\\
In terms of technology, there isn't much of a distinction between \\\\\\\""regular\\\\\\\"" tokens/native assets and NFTs. This is due to the fact that both can be produced using the cardano node cli and are native assets.\\\
Unlike fungible native assets, which might consist of millions of interchangeable tokens, an NFT is a single native asset that cannot be re-minted or destroyed, and it exists on the blockchain in perpetuity.\\\

Cardano has an energetic community and more than two million wallets. If you stick to specific standards, we are keen to try out and engage with new products. Participating now makes you a first mover.\\\
Cardano brings its venture fund. If you build on Cardano you can get\\\
your project funded\\\
. Every 6 to 8 weeks, projects can be proposed, discussed, and voted on by the Cardano community.\\\
Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain. By design, it consumes much less energy and computational power.\\\
Cardano is built with the rigor of high-assurance formal development methods. The consensus mechanism\\\
Ouroboros\\\
was delivered with several peer-reviewed papers presented in top-tier conferences and publications in cybersecurity and cryptography. If you build on Cardano, you build on this foundation.\\\
What you can build on Cardano today\\\

You can add\\\
metadata to transactions\\\
to give transactions a story, a background or even an identity.\\\
You can prove the existence of a file, text or any other data at a specific point in time with\\\
transaction metadata\\\
. You can even use\\\
transaction metadata\\\
to validate and verify external physical products and genuine articles.\\\

How to connect with the developer community?\\\
​\\\
Cardano developers and stake pool operators spread across many different platforms.\\\
We aim to provide a complete overview.\\\
If you are interested in connecting with people from the Developer Portal, either visit\\\
the Discord\\\
or\\\
open a thread in the forum\\\
.\\\
Installation\\\
​\\\
To contribute to the Cardano developer portal, you must first install it locally. We have chosen\\\
Docusaurus 2\\\
, a modern static website generator, as the underlying software.\\\
Requirements\\\
​\\\
Node.js\\\
version >= 16.14 (which can be checked by running\\\
node -v\\\
). You can use\\\
nvm\\\
for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.\\\
Yarn\\\
version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running\\\
yarn --version\\\
). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the\\\
npm\\\
client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.\\\
On macOS you also need Xcode and Command Line Tools.\\\
Local development\\\
​\\\
To get a local development environment, clone the repository, navigate into the\\\
developer-portal\\\
folder, install dependencies, and start the development server. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. By default, a browser window will open at\\\
http://localhost:3000\\\
.\\\
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cardano-foundation/developer-portal.git\\\
cd developer-portal\\\
yarn install\\\
yarn start\\\
Limitations of the development build\\\
The development mode will have minor features not working. For example, only blurry images in the responsive images on showcase and tools, search limitations, and some data has fake values because of performance reasons.\"",\""We'll need a whole node in this layer to send transactions with specified parameters. A full node is often a built binary from the official latest cardano-node repository. There are more options, but we'll concentrate on the Linux version.\\\
So, what kinds of sophisticated transactions can we create with a full node, and how can we do it? Working on the command line and issuing transactions from there is the current method. Stake pool operators must utilize this method of transaction to register their stake pool or make changes to their commitment, among other things. However, we may utilize this method to produce, send, receive, and burn tokens.\\\
In the future, this probably will also be the place where smart contracts are written, tested, and maybe executed if there isn't a visual frontend.\\\
Constraints when working with tokens\\\
​\\\
Since we already learned that interaction with the network is almost always a transaction, we need to be aware of a few things enforced through network parameters.\\\
A fee must always be paid whether issuing a transaction or sending something. Currently, the cost is determined by the size of the transaction (read: how much \\\\\\\""information\\\\\\\"" gets sent). The size of a transaction can range from a simple \\\\\\\""A transmits 2 ada to B\\\\\\\"" to a considerably more sophisticated transaction with additional metadata.\\\
There is a minimum value that must be sent. Currently, the value is set to 1 ada.\"",\""Representation of a project may be\\\
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\\\
## Enforcement\\\
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be\\\
reported by contacting the project team at [code-of-conduct@iohk.io](mailto:code-of-conduct@iohk.io). All\\\
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that\\\
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is\\\
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.\\\
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\\\

faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other\\\
members of the project's leadership.\\\

@greg  Me too and I made it.  I actually can’t look at it very long.\\\
@Carlin, hit me up if you have questions or get something going. I was going to OSS a library (\\\
https://github.com/gtarnoff/omrijs\\\
) but have been wicked busy. I’d love to see that come to life in a reusable way.\\\
A great article and a perfect topic for a project I am working on.  I know that flashing lights and such can cause seizures but I never really considered how even the examples provided can be troubling to people with vertigo etc.  Good point to really help others understand why more is not always better.\\\
Hope I can be heard above the spammers. Great article that explains clearly what happens for me on animated web pages or apps.  I am not aware of having any of the medical conditions you mention. I think what happens for me is that, because of the involuntary motion, my eyes are trying to focus on something that is not focusable. I have no trouble watching most animated films, but do tend to have to trouble with videos that flash frequently between light and dark.\\\
That’s a great illo at the top. I think it might trigger some people that don’t get triggered by the animation issue.\\\
@greg thanks for the github share, like it.\\\

Dolos\\\
Dolos is a new type of Cardano node, fine-tuned to solve a very narrow scope: keeping an updated copy of the ledger and replying to queries from trusted clients, while requiring a small fraction of the resources\\\
Motivation\\\
Cardano nodes can assume one of two roles:\\\
block producer: in charge of minting blocks\\\
relay node: in charge relaying blocks from / to peers.\\\
Each of these roles has concrete responsibilities and runtime requirements. Criteria such as network topology, resource allocation, backup procedures, etc vary by role.\\\
We argue that there’s a 3rd role that should be treated independently with the goal of optimizing its workload: nodes that are used with the sole purpose of resolving local state queries or serving as data source for downstream tools that require ledger data.\"",\""\\\
