# Initial Feedback Summary Report

The following feedback was gathered from 25 surveyed participants whose raw responses may be found here: [cDPT-1 Feedback Form Responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lQ51CA4tDp-ndKYT_IGVovvVaXn5ujjdPl9F3-5SkFI/edit?usp=sharing)

**1. General Performance & Accuracy**  
- Users generally found the chatbot’s responses fast, with impressive speed and decent initial accuracy.  
- The bot offers helpful foundational information—especially for newcomers and less technical users—but there’s uncertainty about the depth of its technical expertise. It sometimes struggled with specialized terms (e.g., “Tokeo,” “Yoke,” “Cardevia”) and occasionally mixed up frameworks (e.g., providing a .NET framework answer to a TypeScript question).

**2. Conversational Flow & User Experience**  
- Many users felt the responses were too “blocky” and not conversational enough. There’s a desire for more natural back-and-forth interaction rather than large text dumps.  
- Suggestions include guiding the user with follow-up prompts, step-by-step lists revealed progressively, and more organic dialogue instead of a “Wiki”-style info dump.  
- The chatbot doesn’t always retain context effectively. For example, follow-up requests for examples didn’t always connect back to the original question, suggesting a need for improved context memory.

**3. User Interface & Visual Design**  
- The current interface is described as dated and difficult to navigate. Scrolling issues were noted, and the chat’s color scheme (e.g., grey background with white text) can hinder readability.  
- Users suggested adding visual indicators that a response is being generated (e.g., a typing animation).  
- Other recommended UI features:  
  - Dark mode or theme options  
  - Hyperlinks for specific crypto terms or advanced concepts  
  - Export/save chat functionality  
  - Buttons to quickly provide feedback or rate helpfulness  
  - A feature to edit previous questions  
  - A copy-to-clipboard button for bot responses

**4. Features & Functionality Requests**  
- Contextual awareness: The chatbot should remember previous questions and answers to provide more relevant follow-ups.  
- Voice chat integration: Allowing users to speak directly and have the bot respond verbally.  
- File attachment capability: Users could share documents or code snippets directly without typing them out.  
- Chat history: The ability to revisit previous sessions easily.  
- More current world knowledge: The bot struggled with simple real-time questions (like the current date), highlighting a need for better real-time information and continuous learning.  
- Expand knowledge base: Although the bot focuses on Cardano, some users want broader support across other cryptocurrencies, as well as improved world and ecosystem knowledge.  
- Improved realism: Subtle enhancements to make the bot feel more “human,” including showing a thought process or offering smaller pieces of information step-by-step.

**5. Technical & Developer-Oriented Feedback**  
- Developers want more detailed technical examples and real code snippets, especially regarding smart contracts on Cardano and related integrations.  
- Requests for improved programming assistance: The bot should be able to provide more specific, accurate, and contextual coding help to support real-world development tasks.  
- Some users noted the chatbot’s general helpfulness for conceptual overviews and planning, but want deeper technical depth as it matures.

**6. Branding & Positioning**  
- Many users acknowledged the chatbot’s similarity to ChatGPT, which can be a strength (familiarity) but also sets a high bar for quality and natural conversation.  
- Several users recognized that this is likely a “beta” or initial version and look forward to improvements in the future.

**7. Overall Impressions & Suggestions for Improvement**  
- Overall sentiment is positive: users see value in the chatbot’s foundational capabilities and view it as a helpful tool for both novices and experienced developers.  
- The top priorities for improvement include:  
  1. Enhancing the conversational feel and interactive nature of responses  
  2. Improving UI elements such as readability, scrolling, and design themes  
  3. Increasing context retention and technical accuracy in follow-up queries  
  4. Adding advanced features like voice integration, file attachments, chat history, and quick rating tools  
  5. Expanding knowledge beyond Cardano and ensuring information is timely and up-to-date.

---

**In summary**, initial feedback on the chatbot highlights that it shows promise, but there’s clear demand for a more interactive, context-aware, and visually appealing user experience. Enhancing conversational dynamics, improving technical and real-time knowledge, and adding user-friendly features will help position this tool as a valuable resource for both new and experienced developers in the Cardano ecosystem and beyond.
